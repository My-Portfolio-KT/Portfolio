## About Me:

#### JavaScript Full Stack Software Developement


My extensive experience with designing and developing websites using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery, Angular, ReactJS, Git/Github, MongoDB
MySQL, Sequelize, Cloudinary, and Gatsby on Rails matches well with your requirements. 
In addition, my background with working in large development teams has given me the skills to adjust to the changing 
dynamics and processes of those environments while meeting scheduled milestones and deliverables.
